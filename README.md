Schedule Generator with Genetic Algorithm and Qt.


Read this if you want to run this program on your computer. Only Windows 64-bit right now.

After building solution you have to copy folders and files from right Qt folder. 
In Qt folders there are text files named "info.txt" which tells you about this Qt version:
"msvc2015_64" - Visual Studio 2015 64-bit
"msvc2017_64" - Visual Studio 2017 64-bit

When you have opened correct Qt folder you have to copy whole FOLDER named "platforms" 
and ALL FILES from "bin" folder into "Debug" or "Release" FOLDER. Depends on your build type.
